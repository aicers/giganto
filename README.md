# Giganto: Raw-Event Storage System for AICE

Giganto is a high-performance raw-event storage system, specifically designed
for AICE. It is optimized to receive and store raw events through QUIC channels
and provides a flexible GraphQL API for querying the stored events. Giganto
empowers AICE with the ability to efficiently handle large-scale data
processing and real-time analytics.

## Features

* Scalable Storage: Giganto provides a scalable and distributed storage system,
  optimized for handling raw events generated by AICE sensors.
* GraphQL API: Giganto offers a powerful and flexible GraphQL API, enabling
  developers to query stored events with ease.
* QUIC Channels: Giganto utilizes the QUIC protocol to enable fast, low-latency
  communication and data transfer.
* High Performance: Giganto is designed to efficiently handle high volumes of
  data, ensuring optimal performance for AICE.

## Usage

You can run giganto by invoking the following command:

```sh
giganto <path to config file>
```

In the config file, you can specify the following options:

```toml
key = "key.pem"                            # path to private key file.
cert = "cert.pem"                          # path to certificate file.
root = "root.pem"                          # path to CA certificate file.
ingest_srv_addr = "0.0.0.0:38370"          # address to listen for ingest QUIC.
publish_srv_addr = "0.0.0.0:38371"         # address to listen for publish QUIC.
graphql_srv_addr = "127.0.0.1:8442"        # giganto's graphql address.
data_dir = "tests/data"                    # path to directory to store data.
retention = "100d"                         # retention period for data.
log_dir = "/data/logs/apps"                # path to giganto's syslog file.
export_dir = "tests/export"                # path to giganto's export file.
max_open_files = 8000                      # db options max open files.
max_mb_of_level_base = 512                 # db options max MB of rocksDB Level 1.
num_of_thread = 8                          # db options for background thread.
max_sub_compactions = 2                    # db options for sub-compaction.
ack_transmission = 1024                    # ack count for ingestion data.
addr_to_peers = "10.10.11.1:38383"          # address to listen for peers QUIC.
peers = [ { addr = "10.10.12.1:38383", hostname = "ai" } ]     # list of peer info.
```

By default, giganto reads the config file from the following directories:

* Linux: `$HOME/.config/giganto/config.toml`
* macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.einsis.giganto/config.toml`

For the `max_mb_of_level_base`, the last level has 100,000 times capacity,
and it is about 90% of total capacity. Therefore, about `db_total_mb / 111111` is
appropriate.
For example, `90`MB or less for 10TB Database, `900`MB or less for 100TB would
be appropriate.

These values assume you've used all the way up to level 6, so the actual values may
change if you want to grow your data further at the level base.
So if it's less than `512`MB, it's recommended to set default value of `512`MB.

If there is no `addr_to_peers` option in the configuration file, it runs in
standalone mode, and if there is, it runs in cluster mode for P2P.

## Test

Run giganto with the prepared configuration file. (Settings to use the
certificate/key from the tests folder.)

```sh
cargo run -- tests/config.toml
```

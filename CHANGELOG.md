Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add functions related to db's `index`.
  - Set the index storage interval according to the `index_creation_period` in
    `config` file.
  - Create an index for the `network raw events` received from `ingest`.

### Changed

- Modified Kerberos event to support giganto-client.
- Change the Graphql API for `network events`.
  - Return results by referencing the index if the query has filtering on
    `orig_addr`/`orig_port`/`resp_addr`/`resp_port`.

## [0.13.1] - 2023-09-18

### Changed

- Change the `statistics` Graphql Api.
  - Removed `core` as an argument to the query. Also changed the condition of
    source to allow searching for `multiple sources`.
  - Provides statistics data by `source`/`time`/`protocol`.
  - If the statistics data type is `statistics`, provide `bps`/`pps`.
  - If it's of type `network` (network-sourced events collected by `piglet`),
    provide `eps`.
  - If there is no value for the protocol field in the filter, statistics are
    provided for `all protocol`.
  - If filter has no value for the time field, it will provide the most `recent`
    statistics.
- Add feature to generate benchmark statistics for ingest events.
- Modify to execute flush when giganto down.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-08-28

### Added

- Add GraphQL query `statistics` to read data from `statistics` store.
  The result format is `Protocol/Size/Count`.
  - `Protocol`: target protocol name like `Statistics`, `Http`, `Dns`.
    `Statistics` is the input traffic statistics of the collector device.
  - `Size`: packet size for `Statistics` or 0 for other protocols.
  - `Count`: packet count for `Statistics` or event count for other protocols.
- Add key generation feature for intuitive data lookup of database in giganto.
  - `StorageKeyBuilder`: This is a builder structure for dynamically generating keys.
    Depending on whether you have 2 or 3 keys, call the `start`/`mid`/`end` function
    to set the keys.
  - `StorageKey`: A structure that stores lookup keys generated by `StorageKeyBuilder`.
  - `KeyExtractor`: A trait for calling the value to be set by the key.
- Supports 14 sysmon events.
- Added `search sysmon event` Graphql Api for `sysmon` supported by giganto.

### Changed

- Replaced `lazy_static` with the new `std::sync::OnceLock`.
- Modify `pcap_with_data` test function to compare times based on utc timezone.
- Change the key of `statistics` store to `source + core id + timestamp` not to
  overwrite statistics data from other core of same machine.
  When Giganto is loading with old DB version, the old data will be removed
  because it's possible to be overwritten by other core's data.
- Change `export` query to support `statistics` store.
  This change makes it possible to export statistics data of only core 0 of
  the collector device. This will be fixed in next change.
- Remove unused `time()` from `RawEventFilter` trait.
- Modify to use `Networkfilter` in `sysmon raw event` Graphql Api.
- Modify statistics migration version to 0.13.0 from 0.12.4.

### Fixed

- Fixed to only generate the `collect_records` error message when an error event
  exists, and applied the same change to `export`.
- Fixed to `export` query for export `statistic data` for all `cores`.

## [0.12.3] - 2023-07-10

### Changed

- Fixed fields of `FtpRawEvent`, `FtpJsonOutput`
- Modified `collect_records` to continue collecting even if error data is
  included in the data.

### Fixed

- Fixed warning from release build.

  `http raw event` in versions 0.12.0 and earlier.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-06-20

### Added

- added Giganto clustering functionality. This feature connects giganto peer-to-peer,

### Changed

- Modify `proto` field of `Ftp`, `Mqtt`, `Ldap` to u8 from u16.

    and `RequestRange`.
  - Add to handle `Timeseries` requests in `MessageCode::RawData`.
  - Modify `multi_get_with_source` to return in the form of
    `Vec<(i64, String, Vec<u8>)>`.

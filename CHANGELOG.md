## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Implemented data transfer functionality between remote Giganto instances,
  enabling local (edge) Giganto instances to forward events to cloud (central)
  Giganto instances.
  - Added new `transfer` module with `TransferClient` for QUIC-based data
    transfer.
  - Added optional `cloud_srv_addr` configuration parameter to specify the
    cloud Giganto endpoint address.
  - Transfer client automatically connects and forwards events when configured,
    with automatic retry on connection failure.
- Enhanced raw event structures with packet count and size information:
  - Added `orig_pkts`, `resp_pkts`, `orig_l2_bytes`, `resp_l2_bytes` fields to
    all raw event structures.
  - Added `duration` field to all raw event structures to store session
    duration.
  - Unified time field types to `DateTime<Utc>` for consistent temporal
    handling.
  - Updated migration functions to handle new event structure fields.
- Introduced a new feature flag, `cluster`, to enable or disable Giganto's
  cluster functionality.
  - When `cluster` is enabled (default), Giganto connects to other instances in
    the cluster and shares data.
  - When `cluster` is disabled, Giganto operates in standalone mode, without
    connecting to other instances. It avoids using GraphQL client functionality,
    allowing it to generate the `schema.graphql` file independently.
- Added a new binary target, `gen_schema`, to generate the GraphQL schema file
  from the API definitions.
- Added `build.rs` to automatically generate the GraphQL schema file during the
  build process.
- Added client certificate support for GraphQL API to enable mutual TLS (mTLS)
  authentication when communicating with other Giganto instances in a cluster.
- Added `start_time` field to all protocol event structures for improved
  temporal tracking and consistency.
  - The `start_time` field represents the session start time and complements
    the existing `end_time` field.
  - Raw event keys, which previously used the session start time, now use the
    actual raw event creation timestamp provided by the sensor application.
- Added RADIUS protocol support with the `RadiusRawEvent` struct and the GraphQL
  APIs (`radiusRawEvents`, `searchRadiusRawEvents`).
- Added `countByProtocol` GraphQL API for precise event counting by protocol type
  (Session, DNS, HTTP). This feature is gated behind the `count_events` feature
  flag and is intended for quality checks and testing. The API iterates over all
  keys in the database to provide exact counts, which may be expensive on large
  datasets.
- Bump bincode crate to 2.0 and modified the related code.

### Changed

- Renamed configuration field `max_sub_compactions` to `max_subcompactions` to
  align with RocksDB naming conventions.
- Modified FTP event structure to store multiple commands as `Vec<FtpCommand>`
  instead of single command fields. This change preserves the complete command
  history of FTP sessions, enabling better threat analysis and session tracking.
  The FTP GraphQL API now returns a `commands` array containing all commands
  and their responses from a session.
- Refactored Publish API to use request type-driven processing. The Publish
  API now processes requests based on their specific request type rather than
  the client's `NodeType`. This change decouples request handling from client
  identity, allowing any client to make any type of request regardless of their
  `NodeType`. This increases flexibility and removes artificial limitations on
  client capabilities.
- Updated `giganto-client` dependency to support the new request type-driven
  processing model.
- Extracted communication-related logic into a separate module named `comm`.
  This refactoring removes common functionality from `main.rs`, preventing
  redundant declarations when adding additional binaries.
- Migrated web server from `warp` to `poem` framework for better maintainability
  and future OpenAPI support. The GraphQL endpoint and playground functionality
  remain unchanged.
- Changed `last_time` field to `end_time` for raw events (Http, Smtp, Ntlm, Ssh,
  Tls, DceRpc, Ftp, Mqtt, Ldap, Smb, Nfs, Bootp, Dhcp) in GraphQL APIs and data
  structures to improve clarity and consistency. The field represents the end time
  of network events and sessions.
- Changed `duration` field to `end_time` for Conn raw events in GraphQL APIs and
  data structures to align with other network event structures and provide clearer
  semantics. This field represents the end time of connection sessions.
- Consolidated HTTP event fields to improve data structure efficiency and reduce
  redundancy. Changes include:
  - Merged `orig_filenames` and `resp_filenames` into single `filenames` field
  - Merged `orig_mime_types` and `resp_mime_types` into single `mime_types` field
  - Renamed `post_body` field to `body` for consistency
  - Updated migration functionality to handle field consolidation from older versions

### Removed

- Removed migration support for versions earlier than v0.21.0. Database
  migration is now only supported from v0.21.0 and above. This change removes
  legacy migration code and improves maintainability by eliminating support for
  outdated application versions.

### Fixed

- Fixed deserialization issue for GraphQL `StringNumber` fields in cluster mode.
  String representations of numbers (e.g., "123456") are now correctly parsed
  into wrapped integer types such as `StringNumberI64(i64)` or `StringNumberU64(u64)`.
- Modified `retain_periodically` function to stop further delete operations on a
  column family when a delete operation fails, preventing cascading failures
  and reducing excessive error logs.
- Fixed the database retention logic for `oplog` and `periodic time series` with
  non-standard key formats. `oplog` now uses timestamp-based range deletion
  instead of sensor-based iteration. `periodic time series` retention is
  temporarily disabled until proper policy-based retention logic is implemented.

## [0.25.1] - 2025-07-08

### Changed

- Updated the roxy library dependency to 0.4.0 to support accurate measurement
  of disk usage at the correct data store path.

## [0.25.0] - 2025-06-18

### Changed

- Updated HTTP header field name from `referrer` to `referer` in GraphQL APIs
  and data structures to maintain accuracy and direct correspondence with the
  HTTP `Referer` header standard. This affects HTTP-related GraphQL queries and
  responses where the field was previously named `referrer`.
- Modified search range boundary handling for consistency. Currently, the
  handling of range search with a single input is inconsistent between time and
  address/port. To address this inconsistency, the `check_address` and
  `check_port` functions have been modified to follow the same behavior as time
  range handling.
  - only the start value is provided: Retrieves all results greater than or
    equal to the start value.
  - only the end value is provided: Retrieves all results less than the end value.
- Updated compatibility versions for QUIC communication and database migration
  - Updated `INGEST_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.23.0,<0.26.0".
  - Updated `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.23.0,<0.26.0".
  - Updated `COMPATIBLE_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.24.0,<0.26.0".
- Updated `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.25.0,<0.26.0" to ensure compatibility
  between Giganto instances in the cluster. This change was made to reflect the
  GraphQL API updates, specifically the change of the `referrer` field name to
  the standard spelling `referer`.

## [0.24.3] - 2025-05-23

### Changed

- Logging behavior no longer considers the debug mode. Previously, logging
  behavior depended on both `log_path` and the build type(debug/release). Now,
  whether logs are written to stdout or to a file is determined solely by the
  presence of `log_path`.
- Giganto now creates a backup before overwriting the config via the
  `updateConfig` GraphQL API. If reading the config fails, it automatically
  restores from the backup, both during `updateConfig` calls and at startup.
- Replaced `--log-dir` with `--log-path` in command-line interface. Now the log
  file path can be specified directly rather than combining a directory and a
  fixed filename.
- Removed dependency on LOG_FILENAME environment variable by eliminating the
  .cargo/config.toml file.

## [0.24.2] - 2025-04-08

### Changed

- Adjusted the `pcap` GraphQL API with the following improvements:
  - Reduced the number of processed packets from up to 1,000 to up to 10,
    lowering resource usage and improving performance when handling large HTTP
    sessions. Ten packets are generally sufficient for client-side inspection.
  - Simplified PCAP generation by removing the intermediate step of reading a
    temporary file into memory and piping it into `tcpdump` via stdin. Now,
    `tcpdump` reads directly from the temporary file, reducing overhead and
    improving efficiency.

## [0.24.1] - 2025-03-14

### Changed

- Documentation of the following GraphQL APIs is updated:
  - `dnsRawEvents`
- Changed default GraphQL API port to 8443.
- Renamed the log file from giganto.log to data_store.log.

## [0.24.0] - 2025-02-19

### Added

- Added the `load_connection_by_prefix_timestamp_key` function and
  `TimestampKeyExtractor` trait to enable querying of keys prefixed with `timestamp`.
- The `opLogRawEvents` GraphQL API no longer requires `agentId` and now accepts
  it as an optional parameter. Additionally, the API response now includes logs
  from all agents displayed in chronological order, rather than being limited to
  the logs of a single agent.

### Changed

- Updated `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.24.0<0.25.0" to ensure compatibility
  between Giganto instances in the cluster. This change reflects updates of
  GraphQL API.
- Updated the giganto-client library dependency to 0.22.0. Since this update
  does not break backward compatibility for modules communicating with Giganto
  via the QUIC protocol, the related version requirements have been adjusted as follows:
  - Updated `INGEST_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.23.0,<0.25.0".
  - Updated `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.23.0,<0.25.0".
- Modify the code related to migration.
  - Changed `COMPATIBLE_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.24.0,<0.25.0".
  - Added migration function `migrate_0_23_0_to_0_24_0_op_log`. This function
    performs a migration to change the key and value of `Oplog`.
- Several changes are made to configuration management via the GraphQL API:
  - The `setConfig` GraphQL API has been renamed to `updateConfig` to better
    reflect its functionality. This API not only accepts a new configuration but
    also applies it by reloading the system. Upon success, the API returns the
    new config. The fields that can be updated via `updateConfig` are the same
    as those retrievable via the `config` GraphQL API.
  - The `updateConfig` GraphQL API returns an error if the provided `new` config
    is an empty string. It also returns an error if the `new` is the same as the
    current configuration, which can be retrieved via the `config` GraphQL API.
    Additionally, an error is returned if the `new` config content is invalid.
    If an error occurs, the update request is not applied.
  - The `config` GraphQL API no longer returns the `logDir`, `addrToPeers`, and
    `peers` fields.
  - The `retention` field in the `config` GraphQL API response now follows the
    "{days}d" format to align with the request format used in `setConfig`
    GraphQL API.
- The term `timestamp` and `timestamps` are replaced with `time` and `times` in
  event structs where the type is `DateTime<Utc>`. This change impacts GraphQL
  APIs that return event data or accept filter parameters that used timestamp.
  Additionally, the JSON files generated by the `export` GraphQL API also use
  the new term.
- Documentation of the following GraphQL APIs is updated:
  - `connRawEvents`
  - `networkRawEvents`
  - `ftpRawEvents`
  - `httpRawEvents`
  - `tlsRawEvents`
  - `kerberosRawEvents`
  - `ldapRawEvents`
  - `mqttRawEvents`
  - `nfsRawEvents`
  - `smbRawEvents`
  - `smtpRawEvents`
  - `sshRawEvents`
  - `dhcpRawEvents`
  - `bootpRawEvents`
  - `dceRpcRawEvents`
  - `rdpRawEvents`
  - `ntlmRawEvents`
- `log_dir` is no longer a configuration item. To specify the log directory, it
  is required to use an optional command-line argument `log-dir`.
- Logging behavior related to command line arguemtn `log-dir` is as follows:
  - If `log-dir` is not provided, logs are written to stdout using the tracing library.
  - If `log-dir` is provided and writable, logs are written to the specified
    directory using the tracing library.
  - If `log-dir` is provided but not writable, Giganto will terminate.
  - Any logs generated before the tracing functionality is initialized will be
    written directly to stdout or stderr using `println`, `eprintln`, or similar.

### Removed

- Removed OS-specific configuration directory.
  - Linux: $HOME/.config/giganto/config.toml
  - macOS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/com.cluml.giganto/config.toml
- Removed the GraphQL API `csvFormattedRawEvents`.

## [0.23.0] - 2024-11-21

### Added

- Added GraphQL API `csvFormattedRawEvents` that returns the values of raw
  events of the request protocol in csv format String, delimited by tab.

### Changed

- Remote configuration is no longer stored in a temporary file, nor does it
  overwrite the existing configuration file.
- Changed GraphQL APIs `config` and `setConfig` to return error when using local
  configuration.
- Modified the repair mode to operate only with a local configuration. Giganto
  now terminates if the repair option is specified without the `-c` flag.
- The term source is replaced with the term sensor, resulting in the following
  major changes:
  - The `sources` column family in the DB is replaced with `sensors` column
    family. Running this version of Giganto will migrate the existing data in
    `sources` column familiy to `sensors` column family.
  - The `sources` GraphQL API is renamed to `sensors`.
  - The `sourceId` field in the `export` GraphQL API is renamed to `sensorId`.
  - The `source` field in the filter parameters of all GraphQL APIs is changed
    to `sensor`.
- Update the compatibility version of the quic communication modules, due to the
  update of giganto-client to 0.21.0.
  - Changed `INGEST_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.23.0,<0.24.0".
  - Changed `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.23.0,<0.24.0".
- Updated `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.23.0,<0.24.0" to ensure compatibility
  between Giganto instances in the cluster. This change reflects updates to the
  GraphQL API version and event protocol, which require consistent versions
  across all nodes.

### Removed

- Removed the GraphQL API `setAckTransmissionCount` as the entire configuration
  is now sent at once when modified through the UI.

### Fixed

- Fixed a missing update to the schema.graphql file necessary for communication
  within the Giganto cluster.

## [0.22.1] - 2024-10-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `Connection` of type `PcapSources` to `Vec<Connection>`. This change
  will allow giganto to find the latest `Connection` and extract pcap even if it
  detects a late disconnect from ingest.

## [0.22.0] - 2024-10-04

### Added

- Added `required` option to `ca_certs` to provide an error message when there
  is no `--ca-certs` execution option.

### Changed

- Changed `config` GraphQL API to include a field indicating whether the
  configuration is local or remote.
- Update the compatibility version of the quic communication modules.
  - `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.21.0,<0.23.0".
  - `INGEST_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.21.0,<0.23.0".
  - `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.21.0,<0.23.0".

### Fixed

- Fixed to create `Config` variable normally when running without config file.

### Security

- Updated dependency for security vulnerabilities.
  - Updated async-graphql to version 7.0.11.

## [0.21.0] - 2024-09-23

### Changed

- Updated the version of giganto-client from 0.15.2 to version 0.19.0. Updating
  to this version results in the following changes.
  - Updated the version of quinn, rustls from 0.10, 0.21 to 0.11, 0.23. With the
    update to this version, the usage of the quinn and rustls crates has
    changed, so code affected by the update has also been modified.
  - Modified code and structures based on changes to the conn, http, smtp, ntlm,
    ssh, tls protocols field.
  - Support bootp, dhcp protocol events.
- Changed to receive events in a unit of 100.
- Modified to append the kind value to the filename when extracting a file for a
  protocol for which a kind value exists.
- Applied code import ordering by `StdExternalCrate`. From now on, all code is
  expected to be formatted using `cargo fmt -- --config group_imports=StdExternalCrate`.
- Changed cluster related configuration field names.
  - `peer_address` to `addr_to_peers`
  - `address` in `peers` to `addr` and `host_name` in `peers` to `hostname`
- Changed GraphQL APIs to return `StringNumber` instead of integers beyond `i32`
  in all applicable APIs.
- Changed command line interface.
  - Removed `cert`, `key`, `root` fields from config file.
  - Added cli options `-c`, `--cert`, `--key` and `--ca-certs`.
- Renamed GraphQL API `gigantoConfig` to `config` and updated it to respond the
  full configuration.
- Renamed GraphQL API `setGigantoConfig` to `setConfig`. The endpoint now
  accepts a full configuration as a TOML string and returns `Result<bool>`,
  instead of `Result<String>`.
- Update the compatibility version of the quic communication modules.
  - `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.21.0,<0.22.0".
  - `INGEST_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.21.0,<0.22.0".
  - `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.21.0,<0.22.0".

### Removed

  - Updated quinn-proto to version 0.11.8.
  - Updated openssl to version 0.10.66.

## [0.20.0] - 2024-05-17

### Added

- Added GraphQL API `ping` and mutation `stop`, `reboot`, `shutdown`.
- Added rocksdb's `increase_parallelism` option. This option is set by reading
  the value from `number_of_thread` in config file.
- Added rocksdb's `set_max_subcompactions` option. This option is set by reading
  the value from `max_sub_compactions` in config file.

### Changed

- Changed logs to stdout and file.
- Modify to extract kind/source correctly on export of `secu log`.
- Modify `retain_periodically` function to run as a separate thread.
- Added the `.export` tag to the file being exported. This tag is removed after
  the file is finished exporting.
- Updated `set_giganto_config` function to record requested configuration
  changes to a temporary toml file. Given the original configuration file name
  as `giganto.toml`, the temporary file is named as `giganto.toml.temp.toml`.
  - If the reload trigger succeeds, the new configuration is applied from the
    temporary file; otherwise, the temporary file is deleted.
- Changed configuration field names.
  - `ingest_address` to `ingest_srv_addr`.
  - `publish_address` to `publish_srv_addr`.
  - `graphql_address` to `graphql_srv_addr`.

- Changed `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.17.0,<0.21.0".

### Removed

- Remove `max_background_jobs` rocksdb option. This option is automatically set
  to the appropriate value when `increase_parallelism` is set.

## [0.19.0] - 2024-02-22

### Added

- Added migration functionality in 0.19.0. This feature deletes the values of
  existing keys in netflow5/netflow9/seculog from versions prior to 0.19.0 and
  inserts the values of new keys.

### Changed

- Modify the `sources` GraphQL API to return results that also include sources
  from its peers.
- Changed the prefix of the `Netflow5`/`Netflow9`/`SecuLog` db key to source.
- Modify the related GraphQL APIs as the db keys for `Netflow5`/`Netflow9`/`SecuLog`
  have been changed to `Netflow5RawEvent`, `Netflow9RawEvent`, and `SecuLogRawEvent`
- Changed `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.19.0,<0.20.0".
- Changed `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.17.0,<0.20.0".

## [0.18.0] - 2024-02-16

### Changed

- Reverted the change of logging from `log-broker` to `tracing`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the default port to `8442`.

## [0.17.0] - 2024-01-24

### Added

- Added the ability to filter via `agent_id` in the filter of a GraphQL query
  requesting a sysmon events.
- Added `SmtpRawEvent` to the return value union of `networkRawEvents` GraphQL API.
- Added `RunTimeIngestSources` type that checks for information from source that
  is connected to ingest in real time. This type is not currently used, but may
  be used in the future to provide real-time connection information.

### Changed

- Modify GraphQL schema file due to the addition of the `agent_id` field.
- Changed `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.17.0,<0.18.0".
- Changed `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.17.0,<0.18.0".
- Modify `export` GraphQL API to set the extension of the extract file according
  to the export type.

### Fixed

- Fix the part of the `export` query in the GraphQL API about validating filters
  for protocols.
- Fix to initialize `ingest_sources` value from `sources` cf on giganto startup.
  This change is intended to ensure that `IngestSources` provide all source
  information for stored data and `RunTimeIngestSources` provide real-time
  connection source information.

## [0.16.0] - 2024-01-08

### Added

- Added to call more flushes within the `handle_data` function of `ingest` that
  receive raw events. This change ensures that data is saved in all cases where
  the `handle_data` function terminates, such as when an `error` occurs.
- Added functionality to control the sending of acknowledgments.
  - Set the `AckTransmissionCount` by reading from the config file.
  - Changed the type of ack transmission count checked in `ingest` from
    `const u16` to `AckTransmissionCount`(`Arc<RwLock<u16>>`).
  - Added `setAckTransmissionCount` GraphQL API to set the ack transmission
    count. This query changes the `AckTransmissionCount` used in ingest and
    `ack_transmission` in the config file to the input `count` value.
- Added documentation for implementing cluster-supported GraphQL APIs in `docs/guide-giganto-cluster-graphql.md`.
- Added `ConvertGraphQLEdgesNode` derive macro that implements `From` trait from
  GraphQL client structs to project structs.
- Supported `log-broker` to send/receive operation log with redis server.
  - Set the redis server with `redis_log_address`, `redis_log_agent_id` and
    `redis_log_fetch_interval` in configuration options.

### Changed

- Modify the `setGigantoConfig` and `gigantoConfig` queries in the GraphQL API
  to read/write the ack transmission count.
- Modify the `setGigantoConfig` and `gigantoConfig` query in the GraphQL API so
  that the fields that take integers read/write the config file for their
  respective types.
- Modify the `gigantoConfig` query in the GraphQL API so that config files that
  work in standalone mode can also be read correctly.
- Changed `export` GraphQL API's response value format from `{export_path}` to `{export_path}@{giganto_node_name}`.
- Changed logging from `tracing` to `log-broker`.
- Changed `PEER_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.16.0,<0.17.0".
- Changed `PUBLISH_VERSION_REQ` to ">=0.16.0,<0.17.0".
- Added giganto cluster support for GraphQL and publish message requests.
- Added `requestFromPeer` argument to GraphQL API: `netflow5RawEvents`,
  `netflow9RawEvents`, `secuLogRawEvents`, `statistics`.

### Fixed

- Fix `retain_periodically`.

## [0.15.4] - 2023-11-22

### Added

- Added GraphQL API `sysmonEvents` to retrieve all sysmon events at once.

### Changed

- Change to use the `batched_multi_get_cf` provided by rocksdb for multi get search.
  - Since `batched_multi_get_cf` is used, add the prefix `batched` to the
    `multi_get_from_ts`/`multi_get_with_source` functions respectively.
- Changed manual boundary check to boundary checking via `iterator_cf_opt`.
- Rename type aliases `PacketSources` to `PcapSources`, `Sources` to
  `IngestSources`, and `StreamDirectChannel` to `StreamDirectChannels`; And move
  their definition location from `ingest.rs` to `main.rs`.
- Modified `retain_periodically`.
  - When disk usage exceeds `USAGE_THRESHOLD` delete old data until disk usage
    is reduced to `USAGE_LOW`.
  - Supports all column families.
  - The iterator stops processing data once it encounters data that is newer
    than the specified retention period.
- Moved `netflow` source to value from key.

## [0.15.3] - 2023-11-09

### Changed

- Changed `check_address` and `check_port` to have a close ended search where it
  will only return the events that contain the address or port for single input.

## [0.15.2] - 2023-11-09

### Changed

- Change `MessageCode::RawData` request processing code to send raw events to
  the Unsupervised Engine in the same format as `MessageCode::RangeData`.

## [0.15.1] - 2023-11-08

### Changed

- Moved `secu_log` source to value from key.

## [0.15.0] - 2023-11-08

### Changed

- Updated giganto-client to 0.15.0.
- Changed minimum/maximum version to 0.15.0 <= version < 0.16.0.

## [0.14.0] - 2023-11-07

### Added

- Added `--repair` option to only fix the database problem then terminated.
- Support `NetflowV5`, `NetflowV9` events. These events does not streamed to the
  Semi-supervised Engine or the Time Series Generator.
- Support `Seculog` events.
  - The `secuLogRawEvents` GraphQL API requires its kind. `wapples`, `mf2`,
    `sniper`, `aiwaf`, `tg`, `vforce`, `srx`, `sonicwall` `fgt`, `shadowwall`,
    `axgate`, `ubuntu`, `nginx`

### Changed

- Modified Kerberos event to support giganto-client.
- Changed `max_background_jobs` to 6 from 2.
- Changed minimum version to 0.13.1.

### Fixed

- Fix potential bug in `retain_periodically`.

## [0.13.1] - 2023-09-18

### Changed

- Change the `statistics` GraphQL API.
  - Removed `core` as an argument to the query. Also changed the condition of
    source to allow searching for `multiple sources`.
  - Provides statistics data by `source`/`time`/`protocol`.
  - If the statistics data type is `statistics`, provide `bps`/`pps`.
  - If it's of type `network` (network-sourced events collected by the Sensor),
    provide `eps`.
  - If there is no value for the protocol field in the filter, statistics are
    provided for `all protocol`.
  - If filter has no value for the time field, it will provide the most `recent`
    statistics.
- Add feature to generate benchmark statistics for ingest events.
- Modify to execute flush when giganto down.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-08-28

### Added

- Add GraphQL API `statistics` to read data from `statistics` store. The result
  format is `Protocol/Size/Count`.
  - `Protocol`: target protocol name like `Statistics`, `Http`, `Dns`.
    `Statistics` is the input traffic statistics of the collector device.
  - `Size`: packet size for `Statistics` or 0 for other protocols.
  - `Count`: packet count for `Statistics` or event count for other protocols.
- Add key generation feature for intuitive data lookup of database in giganto.
  - `StorageKeyBuilder`: This is a builder structure for dynamically generating
    keys. Depending on whether you have 2 or 3 keys, call the
    `start`/`mid`/`end` function to set the keys.
  - `StorageKey`: A structure that stores lookup keys generated by `StorageKeyBuilder`.
  - `KeyExtractor`: A trait for calling the value to be set by the key.
- Supports 14 sysmon events.
- Added `search[sysmon type]Events` GraphQL APIs for sysmon event supported by giganto.

### Changed

- Replaced `lazy_static` with the new `std::sync::OnceLock`.
- Modify `pcap_with_data` test function to compare times based on utc timezone.
- Change the key of `statistics` store to `source + core id + timestamp` not to
  overwrite statistics data from other core of same machine. When Giganto is
  loading with old DB version, the old data will be removed because it's
  possible to be overwritten by other core's data.
- Change `export` GraphQL API to support `statistics` store. This change makes
  it possible to export statistics data of only core 0 of the collector device.
  This will be fixed in next change.
